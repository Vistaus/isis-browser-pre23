About this repository
=====================

This repository is for the Pre 2 and 3 build. Pre 1 support might be coming but I'm not sure it'll fit on the screen yet.
This phone version is currently broken as no one wants to help me figure out why it doesn't connect to WebView, like it does on the Touchpad. So for now it's more like a proof-of-concept...

isis-browser 
============

isis-browser is the enyo browser app for webOS. 

It uses the enyo WebView control to display web content which in turn
uses BrowserAdapter and BrowserServer to talk to webOS webkit.
